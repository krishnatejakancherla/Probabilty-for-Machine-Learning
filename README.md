# Probabilty-for-Machine-Learning


An online shop has recorded the behavior of its customers. The statistics service has dened, for each
customer, the variables X and Y about what the customer has bought during the 30 previous days :
X = number of books the customer has bought
Y = number of CD the customer has bought
Let Z =

X
Y

. The analysis of the collected data has lead to a probability distribution of Z which is in
the le "dsa_proba_data.xlsx"
Questions :
1. Calculate the expectation E(Z) of the random vector Z.
2. Calculate the covariance matrix Cov(Z).
3. Calculate the correlation corr(X; Y ). Are the variables X and Y independent ?
4. We search for the best relation Y = alphaX +beta. The best relation is the relation which minimizes the
expected error.
We hence have to nd the values of alpha and  which minimize
E

(Y 􀀀 X 􀀀 )2
What are the values of  and  ?
